// student-record-management-using-singly-linked-list
// This is demo program to demonstrate operations in singly linked list. Student record management using singly linked list
// In this program I implemented functions:

//INSERT : This function will insert a node into list. The Node will be inserted in sorted order (Ascending).

//PRINT : This will print all nodes value

//SEARCH : this will search an element with key value and if it is in the list then it will return 1 else it will return 0.

//DEL : it will delete an element having specific key value.

//UPDATE : it will update an element.

//PRINT_RECORD : it will print a record of element having specific key value.


// you just need 32 bit c compiler to execute it.
